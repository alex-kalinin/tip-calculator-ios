Tip Calculator
========================================

Hours to complete: 1.5.

Completed user stories:
* [x] Required: A basic tip calculator per video walkthrough at https://vimeo.com/74764846.
* [x] Required: Create a settings page that *displays* the tip amount.
* [x] Required: Save the default percentage value in user settings.
* [x] Optional: Remember the bill amount across app restarts for a period of time (1 minute).

### Notes

The Settings page only displays the tip amount because the app automatically stores the last selected tip amount as a default value. The same UI in the Settings view would be redundant.
